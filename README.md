# Splatshooter

My friend [William](./CREDITS.md#mission-control) just wanted to make a game similar to Splatoon 3.

From the dev team at South Middle School.

If you are someone from Nintendo or just want some more legal information, read [LICENSE](./LICENSE) or read [LEGAL](./LEGAL.md)

This is just a recreation of Splatoon 3 designed to run in the browser so you can play it on almost any device.

# Currently
No, we did not abandon the project. We aren't able to do anything at the moment cuz I'm busy and CATS is not finished yet.
# Aiden Here
How are you

# Dev team
So I'm the only one here who knows how to code. Half our team doesn't even have github :(

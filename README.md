# Splatshooter

Hey Nintendo employees! Please don't sue me. My friend [William](#Dev team) just wanted to make a game similar to Splatoon 3.

# Currently
No, we did not abandon the project. We aren't able to do anything at the moment cuz I'm busy and CATS is not finished yet.
# Aiden Here
How are you

# Dev team
So I'm the only one here who knows how to code. Half our team doesn't even have github :(
